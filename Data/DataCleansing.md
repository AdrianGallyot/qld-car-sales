Sales_data.csv was prepared using a direct match between the raw vechicle data from Redspot on the Make specific.  This was done primarily to ensure a accurate match between data sets
Added a 'Vechile Type' column added to the sales data to broadly categorise by the primary use.  The categories are based on the body type description.
These are as follows:
'Passenger' - Describes a road vechicle user to commuter travel.
'Government' - Service vechicles for government services
'Commerical' - Vechicles that are primarily used for the purpose of industry or construction.
'Agri-Commercial' - Vechicles that are primarily used for argicultural production.
'Motorcycle' - Motorcycle and related vechicles.
'Recreational' - Vechicles primarily used for the purpose of recreational travel.
'TRAILER' - Vechicle trailers
